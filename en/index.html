                In my experience, it is often people who find themselves in crisis who come to psychotherapy. Some have a clear idea of their problems; they mention stressful experiences such as relationship problems, depression, anxiety, illness, separation, grief, trauma, challenging transitional life events (e.g., immigration, marriage, parenthood, retirement), or difficult professional situations or burnout prevention. Some people report a single instance that ignited their suffering. Even a simple feeling that causes some sort of suffering is enough to seek counsel and investigate the pain together: a feeling of helplessness, disorientation, being lost, or maybe tiredness of holding feelings of anger and rage inside. There may be an abundance of self-doubt, difficulties with decision making, or feeling alienated and unconnected from those around oneself, one's community, friends, and family of origin. There is a wide range of reasons why people seek psychotherapy. There are also people who come to therapy with a defined isolated question who request my counsel for a limited time as targeted psychotherapeutic work. All these and more are reasons for starting a therapeutic process.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, it is also possible that one cannot consciously remember anything that has happened, yet the person struggles. You don't have to know your specific problem when you choose to seek psychotherapy; it's enough to be curious to start a process of self-reflection and self-awareness to improve your ability to guide your life towards a self-determined and self-dependent path corresponding to your wishes and goals. The desire or longing for something in life - without necessarily having to have an idea about what that might be - is reason enough to embark on the path toward better mental health and to let go of the dark notion that something is wrong or missing. As one of my analysis patients put it beautifully in words years ago:  <i>“There is no health without mental health. Indeed, the greatest luxury of all is mental wellness.”</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                As a psychoanalyst trained in accordance with the standards of the International Psychoanalytical Association (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ipa.world/">IPA</a>), I can offer psychoanalysis as well as psychotherapy in my private practice. Furthermore, I offer experienced counseling for those uncertain if psychotherapy may help.

              <p>Psychoanalysis, the origin of psychology and a form of modern psychotherapy, can be offered by a clinically trained and qualified psychoanalyst. It typically consists of three, four, or five sessions per week over a period of several years. What sets this scientific method apart is its inclusion of the unconscious alongside the conscious mind in the therapeutic process.</p>
              <p>Psychoanalysis welcomes uncanny fantasies, dreams, and various forms of psychological pain. It is challenging to fully comprehend psychoanalysis without experiencing it firsthand. Nonetheless, attempts have been made to describe psychoanalysis, such as my selection of short visual illustrations, which may provide you with an idea of what psychoanalysis entails.</p>

            <p>
              <b>Costs</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The costs for sessions with me are the responsibility of the patients. My fee for one session of psychotherapy or psychoanalysis is 180 CHF. Typically, I issue invoices at the end of each month, and payment is expected within 20 days. However, individual agreements can be made, such as paying the fee after a specified number of sessions. Payment can be made in cash or via bank transfer. If you prefer alternative payment methods, such as Paypal, or if you would like to receive bills in a different currency, we can discuss these options in person.
            </p>
            <p>The costs for sessions with me will not be covered by the Swiss basic insurance ("Grundversicherung"), even if prescribed by a doctor. However, I am listed as an accredited psychotherapist on santé suisse (the Swiss health insurance association), which allows you to seek reimbursement for a portion of the psychotherapy costs through your supplementary insurance ("Zusatzversicherung"). If you wish to use your supplementary insurance for reimbursement, please clarify the specific conditions and coverage amount with your health insurance company before beginning treatment with me. If you do not have supplementary insurance or are considering changing your coverage, you can find websites that compare supplementary insurances with different levels of cost coverage on the internet.</p>
            <p>It is important to clarify the financing of your treatment before we begin working together. </p>
            <p>
              <b>My offer</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              As a general practice, I offer a package deal for the first three introductory sessions. The price for this package is 450 CHF. This arrangement allows us to get to know each other and gives you the opportunity to decide whether you would like to continue working with me. Please find more details below.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are interested in engaging in psychoanalysis with me and having multiple sessions per week, I am willing to offer a reduced fee per session to support you. Feel free to approach me regarding psychoanalysis!
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Termination</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, we will go through an evaluation and consultation process when we meet at my practice. During the first three sessions, our conversations will be as open as possible, allowing us to get to know each other and for me to gain an understanding of your unique situation. While a comprehensive life history cannot be fully explored within these initial sessions, three sessions are typically sufficient for both you and me to explore the challenges you are facing and to determine the necessary steps forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the third session, we will discuss whether you would like to work with me. The decision to begin psychotherapy or psychoanalysis is entirely up to you, as the treatment ultimately belongs to the patient. I will provide you with my honest recommendation regarding treatment approach and frequency, and we will proceed to establish a framework for our work together. This includes discussing the treatment plan, scheduling appointments, payment arrangements, cancellation policy, availability, and planning for holidays. Setting up this framework during the initial phase is crucial, as it sets the foundation for you and I working well together, both of us sharing the common goal of helping you towards your improved well-being and a more fulfilling life.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are uncertain whether psychotherapy or psychoanalysis is suitable for your needs, you can reach out to me for guidance. As mentioned earlier, we can usually assess this together within the first three sessions. As a general rule, I can provide you with an reasoned  recommendation regarding psychotherapy by the third session.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Cancellation rules and agreements</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you need to cancel a single confirmed session, please notify me at least 48 hours (two work days) in advance. This allows me to reschedule the appointment and avoid charging you for the session. However, if you request a cancellation within 48 hours of your scheduled session, I will need to invoice you for the reserved time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Psychotherapeutic and psychoanalytic treatment is highly personalized, and we establish agreements and arrangements regarding our work together. Changes to appointment terms, session frequency (such as one, two, three, or four sessions per week), and the termination of treatment are typically discussed in person. These agreements regarding the framework of our work together are an integral part of the psychoanalytic process.

              <b>A thought about price and value</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Navigating the vast array of counseling and psychotherapy options available online can feel overwhelming, especially when considering remote sessions. There is a diverse range of professionals with unique qualifications, personalities, perspectives on life, and approaches to therapy, all offering their services at varying prices. It's completely understandable that this abundance of choices can leave you feeling confused, particularly if you're new to long-term psychotherapy.
            </p>
            <p>
              As someone with experience in the field, I'd like to offer some guidance. Take your time when making a decision about who you want to work with, if possible. Psychotherapy is a deeply personal and sensitive journey, where you entrust a professional with your innermost thoughts and emotions. It's natural to want to find someone who truly understands you and can provide the help you need. Don't settle when it comes to your mental health—seek out the professional who feels like the best match for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Choosing the right therapist requires more than just browsing profiles. It's important to meet them in person and gauge your personal connection. Trust your instincts and pay attention to how comfortable you feel during your initial encounter. This decision should be a thoughtful one, guided by your own intuition.

              In accordance with the guidelines and recommendations of the International Psychoanalytical Association (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ipa.world/">IPA</a>), I offer psychotherapy and supervision via video conferencing or phone on exceptional occasions. These exceptions apply during times of pandemics or when access to local psychoanalysts is limited.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initial consultations, as recommended by the IPA, will ideally take place in person and in physical presence whenever possible. Generally, we strive to meet in person for our sessions as often as possible. It is important for a treatment to commence in person, even if it may later be continued online or over the phone during certain phases. We will discuss the individual circumstances under which you may desire psychoanalysis via video conferencing or phone and address the experimental nature of telecommunication-based methods in psychotherapy. There are significant differences between psychotherapy conducted through telecommunication and treatment where both parties are physically present in the same room. These differences are substantial and cannot be overcome. They affect the quality of the therapeutic and analytic treatment, as well as supervision.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are security, privacy, and confidentiality risks associated with all forms of telecommunication that need to be considered and discussed in advance. When it comes to psychotherapy using telecommunication means, the patient must be willing to take joint responsibility with me for establishing the treatment framework and creating a private space during an online session right from the start. We will be mindful of these issues before commencing our work and choose the best possible technical alternative. Feel free to contact me to discuss the possibility of working together remotely.

              I am a licensed and certified psychologist, psychodynamic psychotherapist and psychoanalyst. I completed my training as a psychoanalyst in Frankfurt, Germany, according to the educational standards and requirements for qualification and admission to the International Psychoanalytical Association (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ipa.world/">IPA</a>).
